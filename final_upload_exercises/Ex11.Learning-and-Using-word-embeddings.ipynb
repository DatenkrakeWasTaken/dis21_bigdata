    "\n",
    "This notebook allows for learning how to create and use word embeddings as another popular and powerful way for associating a word with a vector. While the vectors obtained through one-hot encoding are binary and sparse, which means mostly made of zeros as well as high-dimensional, which means show the same dimensionality as the number of words in the vocabulary, \"word embeddings\" are low-dimensional floating point vectors. In other words these are dense vectors, in contrast to sparse vectors. \n",
    "Unlike word vectors created by one-hot encoding, word embeddings are `learned` from data. It is common to see word embeddings that are 256-dimensional, 512-dimensional or 1024-dimensional when dealing with very large vocabularies. On the other hand, one-hot encoding words generally leads to vectors that are 20.000-dimensional or higher (capturing a vocabulary of 20.000 \n",
    "token in this case). So, word embeddings pack more information into far fewer dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to get word embeddings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn word embeddings jointly with the main task, for example document classification or sentiment prediction as already done in the previous exercises. \n",
    "    * start with random word vectors, then learn word vectors in the same way the weights of a neural network are learned.\n",
    "2. Load into the model word embeddings that were pre-computed using a different machine learning task than the one you are trying to solve. \n",
    "    * these are called \"pre-trained word embeddings\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of them is taught in a separate PART of this notebook.\n",

    "    * develop a testplan as you have done before, so you do not change parameters arbitrarily and use a table for the validation results. \n",

    "### Learning word embeddings with the `Embedding` layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to associate a dense vector to a word would be to pick the vector at random. The problem with this approach is that the resulting embedding space would have no structure and that the words \"accurate\" and \"exact\" may end up with completely different embeddings even though they are interchangeable in many sentences. It would be very difficult for a deep neural network to make sense of such a noisy, unstructured embedding space. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why within a good embedding space a geometric relationships between word vectors should reflect the semantic relationships between these words. Hence it would to be expected that the geometric distance (e.g. L2 distance) between any two word vectors do relate to the semantic distance of the associated words. I.e., words meaning very different things would be embedded to points far away from each other, while related words would be closer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, pragmatically seen, what makes a good word embedding space depends heavily on the task at hand. Thus the perfect word embedding space for an English-language movie review sentiment analysis model may look very different from the perfect embedding space for an English-language legal document classification model, because the importance of certain semantic relationships varies from task to task. It is thus reasonable to learn a new embedding space with every new task. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to backpropagation this learning is really easy and thanks to Keras it becomes even easier. \n",
    "Finally it is just about learning the weights of a layer, the so-called `Embedding` layer and this is what PART I is all about."

However, in this case here, there are only 200 training samples available. So let's go for it."
